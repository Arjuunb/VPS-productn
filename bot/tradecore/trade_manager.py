"""Trade management — break-even, scale-out and trailing stops.

The three standard mid-trade moves, as pure logic shared by the backtest
simulator and the live paper engine (one behavior everywhere):

    break-even   — once a trade is +``be_at_r``, the stop moves to entry
    scale-out    — bank ``scale_frac`` of the position at +``scale_at_r``
    trailing     — keep the stop ``trail_r`` behind the best price, optionally
                   armed only after the trade has run ``trail_after_r``

All levels are expressed in R (multiples of the entry risk), so the behavior
adapts to each trade's own stop distance. Checks are conservative: the stop is
evaluated against the bar BEFORE it is moved, and a bar that touches both stop
and target counts as the stop (same pessimistic rule the simulators use).

EVERYTHING IS OFF BY DEFAULT — and that is a measured decision, not an
oversight. Tested out-of-sample across 50 regime scenarios with realistic
fills against the Decision Brain's plain 3R exit (net +175.3R):

    break-even at 1R                 +96.3R   (winners retrace to entry first)
    scale 50% at 1.5R               +124.8R   (caps the 3R runs that pay for losers)
    break-even at 2R                +155.0R
    trail 1R armed at 2.5R          +101.4R   (>1R pullbacks are normal en route to 3R)
    BE 1R + scale 1.5R + trail 1R    +28.2R   (the classic retail combo — worst of all)

Every early-exit rule truncated the big winners more than it saved on losers.
Enable a config here only after validating it on real market data.

ONE exception earned its place: a LOOSE time stop (max_hold_bars=150, about
six days on 1h bars). Measured out-of-sample: tuning +176.7R vs +175.3R,
holdout +94.7R vs +90.6R, mixed-vol identical — neutral-to-positive on every
suite, and it guarantees no position can sit stale forever. Tight time stops
are as destructive as the other early exits (40 bars: +119.6R) — do not
shorten it without re-measuring.
