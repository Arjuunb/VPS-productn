"""Make the Hub's sibling packages importable during test collection, and seed
the local historical store so the REAL-data replay path is exercised in tests.

Replay now refuses to fall back to synthetic data (production never fakes data),
so tests must provide candles through the same channel production uses: the
local Binance cache. We populate a temporary SQLite store with deterministic,
real-shaped OHLCV (generated once) and point ``settings.market_db`` at it. This
is a test fixture only — production reads genuine Binance history.
