"""Tiny TTL cache for expensive analysis endpoints.

The dashboard polls analysis routes (strategy league, marketplace ranking)
that each run many full simulations. On a small instance an uncached poll can
stall the API for tens of seconds and starve the trading engine's thread.
Successful results are cached for a short TTL keyed by the request params;
errors and unavailable results are NOT cached, so recovery is immediate.
