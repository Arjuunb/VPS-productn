"""The adapter between live account state and the Portfolio Engine.

The engine's own tests prove the mathematics. These prove the translation: that
the paper account is described accurately, that a broker the platform cannot
read is reported as unreadable rather than as empty, and that the endpoint
carries the caveats along with the numbers.

The recurring theme is the one thing an adapter can quietly get wrong — filling
a gap with a plausible value. Every test here that looks like it is about a
missing price is really about that.
